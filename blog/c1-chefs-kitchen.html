      It seems Dev Bootcamp brings in a strong holistic aspect to programming. There is a strong emphasis on mental balance as well as emotional discipline and empathy when it comes to working with others. I am very excited to join DBC for those reasons. In the past I have had a tendency to over-do one thing and burn myself out because I could not find a healthy balance. Over the years I have become better at finding a better work-life balance, but I am excited to learn new ways to maintain productivity by working in a sustainable way. I really love the emphasis on a holistic approach to work with meditation and emotional self-awareness.

      In addition, DBC places an emphasis on hands on work as opposed to typical lectures. I have always learned best by doing things myself and working on group and solo projects that are not structured from top to bottom. It seems that DBCâ€™s learning mission aligns with that type of learning. I am very excited to participate in that type of environment.

        I worked in advertising for three years and I plan to return to that industry, but I have decided to take a hiatus to participate in the DBC program. I look at this time in my life as an education vacation/journey where I get out what I put in. So I not so nervous about the program or the environment, but I am anxious to get started everyday and really get the most out of this experience.
