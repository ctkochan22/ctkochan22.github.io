## About Me

I am a full-stack developer with a strong background in market research. I am extremely interested in how people engage with a product and experience a brand. After doing everything in marketing from writing website copy for start-ups to market research for beer & spirit brands, I transitioned into development because I wanted to actually build the services consumers use and need.

I also have experience in digital illustration, half from work, half from creating labels for my houseâ€™s homebrew and bringing my super secret graphic novel to life.
