      <div id="text_body">
        <p>“About Me.” I hate this part. </p>

        <p>Whether it appears on a dating app questionnaire or is brought up in an interview. Whether it is posed as “Who are you?” or “Tell me something about yourself.” I hate this part. Such a simple prompt, and yet it forces you to boil down everything about yourself into a quirky, yet sophisticated… witty, yet insightful elevator pitch, that in some cases, cannot be longer than 140 characters. </p>

        <p>“My name is Kosuke, but I go by Chris. I live in San Francisco.”
          <br>– Too bland.</p>

        <p>“I went to Duke and majored in psychology and minored in economics”
          <br>– Too formal and who cares?</p>

        <p>“I swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco this summer and am training for a triathlon”
          <br>– Too braggy. </p>

        <p>“I am a family-oriented person, a competitive gift-giver, and I like to illustrate in my free time.”
          <br>–What is this? Tinder?</p>

        <p>“I loved working in advertising and am learning about computer science so that I can apply what I have learned to an industry moving towards web and mobile development.”
          <br>–Too “Linked-In” and it’s way over 140 characters.<br><br></p>

        <p>The "About Me" prompt is a hard one to answer. And even great answers don't guarantee an accurate one. In the end, the best way to understand who I am is by looking through my experience, my portfolio, and meeting me in person. So by now you have a brief overview of who I am, reach out to me if you want to meet in person.</p>

<!--         <p>If I had to ask one of these “Who are you” questions, I’d ask what their favorite drink is. That is something I can answer.</p>

        <p>Bourbon and soda with an orange slice and some mint leaves. </p>

        <p>I like a bite to a drink and bourbon has that nice balance between bite and smooth that feels like a good handshake. The orange slice is important because if I went out of my way to add that treat in, it was a good day. A good day where I woke up early, crisp and aware. A day where I made it to the gym before work and swam my best 1000m. If I stopped by the store to buy mint and mushed them up at the bottom of my glass, I had a killer work-day. I worked well with my teammates, had an actionable list of goals for the day, and finished my tasks with the feeling of accomplishment because my manager did a great job of placing my work in the context of how it contributed to the growth of the company. And finally, the soda would make this a 20 minute drink—enough time to reflect on my day and wind down.</p> -->
